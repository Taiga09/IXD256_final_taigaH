IMU sensor with p5.js

## Final Project Description: 
This assignment is the beginning of the Final project for this course. As with the last project, your prototype should include inputs (sensors, buttons, switches, etc.) and outputs (lights, sound, actuators like servos, motors, relays) that have a relationship between each other expressed through interaction and implemented with code/software and electronics/hardware.

In addition, the project should incorporate a cloud/IoT (Internet of Things) component that features some form of remote communication/operation.  In this context, a part of your project may exist online as a visualization, virtual object or some other expression or action that does not have to have visual form.  You can also consider 2 physical objects connected through the cloud (although this would likely require you to obtain an additional programmable microcontroller with network connectivity).

Besides the technical requirements the project is quite open-ended, so try to be imaginative with your concepts and aim for something that you can enjoy creating and experimenting with in the remaining weeks and hopefully beyond this course as well.

## Introduction:
I had 2 big initial ideas, which are using IMU(Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors or Capacitive sensors to control or create sketches on p5.js. I decided to use IMU sensor, in the end. For this concept, I was inspired by this project. [Finger User Interface](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/finger-user-interface)

## Implementation:
Explain your process of prototype development including all applicable aspects such as hardware (electronics), firmware (arduino code), software (p5.js or other code), integrations (Adafruit IO, IFTTT, Arduino IoT cloud, etc.), enclosure and mechanical design. Use a separate subheader for each part:
